# COVID forecasting map

This subfolder contains the backend code to construct the DDL COVID forecasting interactive map, [hosted here](http://www.devdatalab.org/covid-forecase). Forecast variables such as prospective Rt featured in the map are provided by [COVID_metrics](https://twitter.com/COVID_metrics), and supplement DDL COVID data from this repository.


Note: this codebase is not intended to be entirely executable or reproducible, rather by open-sourcing we hope to share our methodologies and increase transparency of the approaches taken in the data processing steps for the DDL COVID forecasting map.
